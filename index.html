            <h4>
                 Simple, grounded, and humbleâ€”it's no surprise that Tendulkar became a household name.
                He's been captain, he's been number one in the world, but more than that, he's been the mentor,
                guide, philosopher-friend that most people didn't know they needed. Empathy and compassion come as
                naturally to him as his straight drive.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Tendulkar also appealed to the ordinary Indian because of his understated personality.
             He stayed clear of controversy. He was devoted to his wife and children.
              He mentored younger players in the team.
